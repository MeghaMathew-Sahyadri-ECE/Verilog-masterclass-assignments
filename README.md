## 🛠️ How to Simulate

You can run all testbenches using [EDA Playground](https://edaplayground.com/) or locally using **Icarus Verilog**:

### Using EDA Playground
🔹 Choose Icarus Verilog 12.0 under Tools & Simulators

🔹 Enable Open EPWave after run to view waveform graphs

🔹 Paste the design and testbench code in the respective panels

🔹 Click Run
